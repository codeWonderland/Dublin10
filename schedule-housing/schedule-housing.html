            <p>Dublin Dialogues</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Putting Study Abroad to Work: How to Leverage Your International Experience Early in Your Career</p>
                    <p>Less than 4% of U.S. college students study abroad for a semester or more during their undergraduate career. Even fewer can use their abroad experience to position themselves ahead of the competition in a job search. Hear early Dublin alumni explain how they leveraged their experience in the workplace. Come prepared with contributions to share or with questions about how your study abroad experience can help you in your professional life.</p>
                <li><p>Ireland–U.S. Relations: the View from Both Sides of the Atlantic</p>
                    <p>The United States and Ireland are intimately linked by economics and a long history of Irish immigration to the States. However, the perspectives on the relationship may differ depending whether we are viewing it from the Irish side or the American side. Join faculty based in both Ireland and the U.S. for a debate on the nature of the Ireland–U.S. relationship.</p></li>
                <li><p>What’s Been Happening in Ireland Since You Left?</p>
                    <p>A lot has changed in Ireland in the past 10 years. In addition to recovering (for the most part) from the financial crash, Ireland became the first country to approve same-sex marriage by public vote, brought the abortion debate to the fore, and is now dealing with the ugly consequences of Brexit.</p></li>
                <li><p>Student Reflections in the Years After Study Abroad</p>
                    <p>Join Champlain Dublin alumni, ranging from the early years to more recent Dubliners, for a series of stories and reflections on how study abroad affected their personal and professional lives. Come prepared to share your own reflections during this open session.</p></li>

This is your chance to experience the games again and challenge your fellow study abroad peers in a fun match. (Don’t worry—we will provide a demo and a chance to brush up on the rules!) Remember, this is not just sport, but a staple of Irish social life and a part of the country's history. Let’s have a bit of craic!
